# MyReads Project

The MyReads project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project provides an API server and client library that persist information as you interact with the application and provides a list of titles on the search page.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) to install MyReads.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

Once this command is executed, MyReads will run on your browser.

You can move the books between the different Shelves of your library by pressing the Dropdown menu on each book. You can also remove the book from the library by selecting the 'none' option on the dropdown.

You can add new books to the library by pressing on the '+' icon on the bottom right. This opens the search page, where new titles can be added. Only the terms in the file SEARCH_TERMS.md will yield results.
